            Welcome to my marketplace! I'm Shinji Ikari, a sophomore Finance major that has always had a hatred for E-bay and Craigslist. Rather than sell my old stuff on some <em>shady</em> sites like those mentioned, I decided to assemble a team and build our own! I'm all about knowing what I'm buying and who from on the internet, so I thought it best to provide that same service to everyone that would be shopping with me. I plan to keep this site going for as long as I have stuff to hand down and move on from, but I may pass the torch someday! If you have any issues while using the site, feel free to reach me at the following methods so we can get it sorted! Thank you for shopping with me!
